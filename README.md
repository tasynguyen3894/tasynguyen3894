# Hi there

I'm a software engineer. I have a passion for learning new knowledge and sharing my knowledge with others.

## I work on

### Backend

PHP is The backend language I spend most of my time working with. I worked with Laravel for REST API, queue handler, and UI in PHP. Besides, I also work with Python (FastAPI) and NodeJS (Express, Nitro, H3).

### Frontend

In the front end, I have had chances to work with React, Vue, and Angular. Vue is my favorite weapon. I can play with Vue (2 & 3) with its ecosystems (Pinia/Vuex, Vue router, Vitest, Cypress, Vite...) and make the output in multi-platform like web (SPA, SSR with Nuxt), Mobile (Ionic, Capacitor), Desktop application (Electron). For React, I also work it in class and functional style with its tool (React Router, Redux, Jest...).

### Deployment

For the deployment, I can do some basic stuff like deploy the PHP application and SPA somewhere like EC2, S3, or CloudFront in AWS.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I like to write something. This is my blog: blog.sangnguyen.dev
